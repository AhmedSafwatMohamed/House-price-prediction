# House Price Prediction 🏠📈

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict house prices using the dataset from the [Kaggle House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) competition.

## 📌 Project Overview

The dataset contains information on residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The goal is to predict the final sale price of each home based on various features like size, location, number of rooms, year built, etc.

## 🚀 Objectives

- Explore and clean the dataset.
- Perform feature engineering and selection.
- Apply multiple regression models.
- Evaluate model performance using RMSE and R².
- Optimize the best model using GridSearchCV.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Ridge & Lasso Regression
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Model Evaluation

The models used in this project include:

- Ridge Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost Regressor

Model performance is evaluated using:
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

## 📈 Results

The XGBoost model provided the best results with high accuracy and low error rate, making it the most suitable for predicting house prices in this case.
